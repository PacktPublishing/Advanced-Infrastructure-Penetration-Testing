# Advanced Infrastructure Penetration Testing
This is the code repository for [Advanced Infrastructure Penetration Testing](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/advanced-infrastructure-penetration-testing?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788624480), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
It has always been difficult to gain hands-on experience and a comprehensive understanding of advanced penetration testing techniques and vulnerability assessment and management. This book will be your one-stop solution to compromising complex network devices and modern operating systems. This book provides you with advanced penetration testing techniques that will help you exploit databases, web and application servers, switches or routers, Docker, VLAN, VoIP, and VPN.

With this book, you will explore exploitation abilities such as offensive PowerShell tools and techniques, CI servers, database exploitation, Active Directory delegation, kernel exploits, cron jobs, VLAN hopping, and Docker breakouts. Moving on, this book will not only walk you through managing vulnerabilities, but will also teach you how to ensure endpoint protection.

Toward the end of this book, you will also discover post-exploitation tips, tools, and methodologies to help your organization build an intelligent security system.
By the end of this book, you will have mastered the skills and methodologies needed to breach infrastructures and provide complete endpoint protection for your system.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
def intialize
super(
'Name' => 'TCP scanner',
'Version' => '$Revisiov: 1 $',
'Description' => 'This is a Demo for Packt Readers',
'License' => MSF_LICENSSE
)
```

To get the most from this book, readers should have some technical information security experience and be familiar with common administrative tools in Windows and Linux. Readers should read this book actively; in other words, after being exposed to new information or tools, it is highly recommended to practice and search for more scenarios and capabilities.  

Read the book with a goal in mind and try to use it or a part of it as an action plan toward making your infrastructure more secure. 

The following are the requirements:

Microsoft Windows OS
Kali Linux (installed or hosted in a virtual machine) 
2 GB RAM or more
Internet access
Wireless card or adapter supporting Kali Linux
